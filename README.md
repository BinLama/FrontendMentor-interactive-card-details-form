## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Tailwind makes writing css easier and less time consuming.

NOTE: **Move Pictures that you want to import in tailwind to public files and use the css below.**

```jsx
<section className="bg-[url('../imagename.type')]">...</section>
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I am going to use Tailwind CSS and React together. These two are powerful tools and I believe that learning them would make many things possible for me.

### Useful resources
